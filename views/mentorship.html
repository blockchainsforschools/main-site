		<p> Our mentoring program: running September-May, the BFS Mentoring Program connects high schoolers with mentors in the space. These mentors consist of software engineers, business executives, researchers, and investors who are actively working within blockchain industry at companies like Google, McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Yahoo, Forbes, Ethereum, Consensys, Livepeer, and ThoughtWorks. We started our first mentoring sessions in September with 100 people, and these sessions will continue throughout the school year. Our first iteration of the mentoring ended with 180 participants (100 mentees, 80 mentors). We received $1,200 in grants from the Ethereum Community Fund to fund these sessions.
