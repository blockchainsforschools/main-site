		<p>Our summer internship program: running in July, Summer Immersion connects high school students to companies that are in need of interns. We create relationships with startups and companies to create internships that did not exist, and then match high schoolers that apply through our program to them. Our first iteration occurred in July 2019, with 65 students from 5 states (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Washington, and Texas) working at 20 blockchain companies based in NY, CT, London and Bangkok. We host monthly workshops for them in partnership with Coinbase, Consensys, IBM, and the New York Blockchain Center.

		<p> Our mentoring program: running September-May, the BFS Mentoring Program connects high schoolers with mentors in the space. These mentors consist of software engineers, business executives, researchers, and investors who are actively working within blockchain industry at companies like Google, McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Yahoo, Forbes, Ethereum, Consensys, Livepeer, and ThoughtWorks. We started our first mentoring sessions in September with 100 people, and these sessions will continue throughout the school year. Our first iteration of the mentoring ended with 180 participants (100 mentees, 80 mentors). We received $1,200 in grants from the Ethereum Community Fund to fund these sessions.
