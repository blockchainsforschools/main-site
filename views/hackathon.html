					Blockchains4Hacks is one of the first introductory blockchain-focused hackathons open to high school
					and college students. For 24 hours, students will learn about ways to integrate blockchain into
					their applications, hacking away at challenges, and building applications that integrate those
					services. We plan to host workshops leading up to the hackathon, allowing participants to immerse
					themselves in blockchain before building their projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					In our continued commitment and support for diversity, we plan to offer travel reimbursements for
					students who are not located in NYC. We also plan to set funds aside specifically for hackers whose
					backgrounds are commonly underrepresented in the tech industry, in addition to low income students.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our hope is that students will walk away with a deeper knowledge of blockchain as well as firsthand
					experience on how to use the technology. We also hope that the projects created at this hackathon
					will blossom and continue even after B4H 2020 is over.

				<h3 id="faq-header">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				<h5 id="faq-question">What is a hackathon?</h5>

				<p id="faq-answer"> A hackathon is a gathering where you can come together with other engineers, programmers, and cool people to you turn your ideas into a real project in 24 hours. You take care of hacking, programming, creativity, and having a good time. We provide the venue, mentors, fun activities, speakers, workshops, food, friends, and almost everything you’ll ever need. </p>
					
				<h5 id="faq-question">	Who can participate in B4H?</h5>
					
				<p id="faq-answer">	Anyone enrolled as a student can attend! (That includes both high school and college students!) Students with an interest in blockchain technology are highly encouraged to apply! If you don't fit that description, you are welcome to attend as a mentor or volunteer.</p>
					
					<h5 id="faq-question">What if I don’t understand blockchain technology or know how to develop applications using it?</h5>
					
					<p id="faq-answer">Don’t worry! We will be having extended 3-hour workshops at the start of the hackathon presented by our sponsors for students who don’t understand blockchain. These workshops will walk through the technology, what it’s used for, and how to develop with it! Additionally, professional blockchain software engineers will be onsite to assist with any questions you might have!</p>
					
					<h5 id="faq-question">How much does B4H cost?</h5>
					
				<p id="faq-answer">	Absolutely nothing on your end!  We provide food, swag, workspace, and WiFi for your entire 24 hours. Not only will we cover you for the weekend, we can even help some people cover travel. That’s right! Here at B4H we want to make things as accessible as possible for those who need it. For more info, see the FAQ below! </p>
					
				<h5 id="faq-question">	Will you be offering travel reimbursements?</h5>
					
				<p id="faq-answer">	Here at B4H, one of our missions is to support minorities in tech with their goals. While we can’t guarantee reimbursements for everyone, we will be offering some reimbursements.  Please indicate that you need travel reimbursement in your application and answer the questions! 
					
					We will be considering factors such as family income and demographic underrepresentation, so low income students or underrepresented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.  We will try to accommodate everyone with at least partial reimbursement if they are outside of the NYC area, subject to a sliding scale. 
					
					For high school students, we’re happy to announce we’ve partnered with Execute Big to provide travel reimbursements! Once you fill out the form and we determine you’re eligible, your information be passed on to them for consideration! If you are accepted, congratulations! You’ll be covered at least in part by Execute Big. If you aren’t accepted, you will then be considered for reimbursement by our team. 
					
					For college students, you will be considered for reimbursement by our team. Stay tuned — we’re working out a partnership for college student reimbursements as well!
					
					Don’t forget to apply by our travel reimbursement deadline, which is TBD! </p>
					
					
				<h5 id="faq-question">	What should I bring?</h5>
					
				<p id="faq-answer">	Bring a photo ID, your laptop and charger, a change of clothes, toiletries, a sleeping bag/blanket, your hacker setup, and yourself! </p>
					
				<h5 id="faq-question">	What if I don't have any coding or hacking experience?</h5>
					
			<p id="faq-answer">		B4H is here to help! During the hackathon, we have beginner workshops and mentors to help you throughout your stay. No prior experience is necessary! Not only do we want you to be able to build something incredible, we’re preparing individuals without blockchain experience via our workshop sequences before our hackathon! Visit this page to find out more about our workshops. Link is TBD. </p>
